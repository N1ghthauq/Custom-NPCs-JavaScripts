# Custom-NPCs-JavaScripts
JavaScripts for custom NPCs

This is for simple and complex scripts of all kinds written in javascript for Noppes Custom NPCs.
This is mainly for my use and a few others but if you see something or want to just do whatever I geuss it's okay, just don't delete
anyhting that you didn't put there, which is why I ask that when you add something please put it in a folder thats named after what you
want to be credited by eg "N1ghthauq" or "IPlayWith2Fps"
This repository is for JavaScript.
